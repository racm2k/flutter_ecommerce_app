## Description
This is a personal project. Currently in review on Play Store for open testing.

## Technologies Used

RIght now I am using:
- Firebase Authentication(Facebook sign in enabled).
- Cloud Firestore to store some users, their orders and shopping cart.
- Cubit for state management.
- Branch.io for deep links.
- [Maps Launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/maps_launcher) to open maps with directions to the store.

More technologies will be used in the future. I'll keep this updated.
