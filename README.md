# Garbo App

## Description
This is a personal project based on an ecommerce website [Garbo](https://www.garbo.pt).
The website doesnÂ´t have much funtionality like authentication, purchases, payments, etc.
The purpose is to try implement these new functionalities

## Technologies Used

RIght now I am using:
- Firebase Authentication for, well you guessed it, authentication.
- Cloud Firestore to store some user data like username, profile picture, etc.
- Cubit for state management.
- Branch.io for deep links.
- [Maps Launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/maps_launcher) to open maps with directions to the store.

More technologies will be used in the future. I'll keep this updated.

## Next Steps

- Create a profile page.
- Create shopping screen for the products with search functionality, and product details screen .
- Right now the products you see in the app are mocked.
  In the future I'll integrate a database to persist and manage these products.
- Add english version and use dynamic strings.
